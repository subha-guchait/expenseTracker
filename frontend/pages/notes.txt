-how can i add expense 
-how can i tell the backend which user has added expense and which users expenses i have to show

one easy solution -
- when the user login we have get the userid from backend
- store the user id to local storage

-then in post request for expense we will pass the user id in expensedetails json 
-but for get request when we have to get all expenses we can't pass any body so here we can pass user id in the params in api routes 

--instead of passing it in routes and json we can pass it in header that will easy for us i didn't have to pass in routes and body
---we can set header by axios.setHeader it will be one time process so we don' have to pass user id every time

-but here is also problem if someone know userId they can easly add and delete expenses 

right solution
- After sucessfull login (checking email and password in backend) we will generate a token in backend sent the token to fronend

- we encrypt the userId with secret key (secret key can be any random string saved in backend) to get token [here we use jwt library to generate token]
-- userId + secretkey -> encryption -> token
-after getting token in frontend we set the token as key value pair in localstorage

-so whenever we have to make request to the backend:
- we send token in header to make request to backend
-in backend we get token and will decrypt it with secret key and will get the user id
-- header -> token
-- token -> decrypt with secret key -> userId

-if someone tempered token we will get error
---tampered token -> decrypt with secretkey -> error
