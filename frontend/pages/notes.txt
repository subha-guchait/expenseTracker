-how can i add expense 
-how can i tell the backend which user has added expense and which users expenses i have to show

one easy solution -
- when the user login we have get the userid from backend
- store the user id to local storage

-then in post request for expense we will pass the user id in expensedetails json 
-but for get request when we have to get all expenses we can't pass any body so here we can pass user id in the params in api routes 

--instead of passing it in routes and json we can pass it in header that will easy for us i didn't have to pass in routes and body
---we can set header by axios.setHeader it will be one time process so we don' have to pass user id every time

-but here is also problem if someone know userId they can easly add and delete expenses 

right solution
- After sucessfull login (checking email and password in backend) we will generate a token in backend sent the token to fronend

- we encrypt the userId with secret key (secret key can be any random string saved in backend) to get token [here we use jwt library to generate token]
-- userId + secretkey -> encryption -> token
-after getting token in frontend we set the token as key value pair in localstorage

-so whenever we have to make request to the backend:
- we send token in header to make request to backend
-in backend we get token and will decrypt it with secret key and will get the user id
-- header -> token
-- token -> decrypt with secret key -> userId

-if someone tempered token we will get error
---tampered token -> decrypt with secretkey -> error


-Problem: How to select a selcted number of coulumn in sequlize from a database table
-in the expense table we have so many coulmn but we need only amount and userId
--ans: const expenses = Expnse.findAll({attributes:['userId','amount']})
--by use attributes we can specify which coulmn we need


-Problem: How to group by in Sequelize
-sol: we can group by single coulmn or multiple coulmn

-for single coulumn
-- Here I group totalExpenseAmount by each userId

const userAggregatedExpenses = await Expense.findAll({
      attributes: [
        "userId",  // Group by this column
        [Sequelize.fn("SUM", Sequelize.col("amount")), "totalAmount"], // sum is operator which operation we wnat to do we can do average multiplication etc
      ],
      group: ["userId"], // Group by category
    })

--for multiple coulmn
-- if I want to group totalExpenseAmount by userId and category

const userAggregatedExpenses = await Expense.findAll({
      attributes: [
        "userId",
        "category"
        [Sequelize.fn("SUM", Sequelize.col("amount")), "totalAmount"], // Aggregate
      ],
      group: ["userId","category"], 
    })



-- prob: Using  sql join how we can get total expense
 -sol: 
    const leaderboardOfUsers = await User.findAll({
       attributes: [
         "id",
         "name",
         [Sequelize.fn("sum", Sequelize.col("expenses.amount")), "totalExpense"],
       ],
       include: [{ model: Expense, attributes: [] }], // this is 2nd table which we want to join
       group: ["user.id"],
       order: [["totalExpense", "DESC"]],
     });
